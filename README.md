# shopping
This is a mock shopping site that I have created to improve front-end skills, particularly with React. At this current version at May 14 2022
I have a working version that functions as expected. All I need to add is quality of life features, code optimizations, and make the site
appealing. This is where the build of the site is stored and ran from, but the source code should be here [source code](https://github.com/Johnny-Rport/shopping)
